# Feature Toggle & Dark Launch System

Implementing feature toggles and dark launch flows for risky features with AI-driven rollout constraints.

# Objective
Reduce deployment risk, improve quality & stability by implementing feature toggles and dark launch flows.

# Steps
1. Add toggle service (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Unleash)
2. Route traffic to new feature (dark launch)
3. Monitor metrics (error rates, latency)
4. Automate rollback mechanisms

# Benefits
- Reduced risk of deploying new features
- Improved feature quality and stability
- Enhanced user experience through controlled rollout
- Faster iteration and deployment of new features
